## Udacity Webcasts

**Note**: To view webcasts, you will need to be a member of [Udacity's Full Stack Web Dev Nanodegree Community][1], a private Google Plus community. You will likely need to be enrolled in the Full Stack Web Developer Nanodegree to be granted access to the community.

It is *highly recommended* that you visit the main community events page, as there are many interesting and helpful archived webcasts covering topics related to full stack development while not being project specific.
